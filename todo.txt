- ** Check for admin priv, code needs it to get CPU temp
- Make it run forever
- Figure out simple way to isolate desired values
    Desired values:
        + GPU temperature
        + CPU temperature
        + GPU load
        + CPU load
        + RAM load
- Figure out how to turn into executable (or at least file you can double click to run)
- Create very basic GUI for executable that lets you adjust stuff 
- Figure out stuff to let user adjust
- Add arduino code to this repo
- Implement arduino code 
    + Read serial
    + Movement rate of arm so that there isnt a servo just constantly going from 0 to 14 to 3 to 83 on the CPU load gauge
    + add lights?
